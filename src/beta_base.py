"""
Base class for BetaCog for `modules.beta.py`.

In `modules.beta.py` I quickly beta-test some things. It's a bit silly but very efficient.

The purpose of the current file is to minimize amount of imports and lines of code
for anything we're going to do while beta-testing. The performance cost of extra imports is probably
negligible compared to annoyance to type them manually out every time we need them.

For an example of how starting template for `modules.beta.py` looks - you can look in `examples` folder.
